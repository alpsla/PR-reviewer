# TypeScript React Component Type Coverage Example

This project demonstrates comprehensive TypeScript type coverage in a React component, achieving 100% type safety. It serves as an example of TypeScript best practices in React applications.

## Project Overview

The project includes a fully typed React user management component with the following features:

- User authentication and management
- Admin panel with role-based access control
- Type-safe state management
- Comprehensive TypeScript type coverage

## Key Features

### Type Definitions
- Custom type guards for role checking
- Mapped types for user permissions
- Conditional types for admin properties
- Utility types for readonly and partial user data
- Explicit type definitions for all state setters and hooks

### Components
1. **UserComponent**
   - Fully typed props interface
   - Type-safe event handlers
   - Proper state management with TypeScript
   - Role-based rendering

2. **AdminPanel**
   - Type-safe props
   - Conditional rendering based on user role
   - Admin-specific functionality

### Custom Hook
- `useAuth` hook with proper TypeScript types
- Async data fetching with type safety
- Proper cleanup function typing

## Type Coverage Improvements

The following improvements were made to achieve 100% type coverage:

1. Added explicit type annotations for state setters:
   - `SetUserFn`
   - `SetLoadingFn`
   - `SetEditingFn`

2. Implemented proper function types:
   - `FetchUserFn` for API calls
   - `AuthHookResult` for hook return types
   - Return type annotations for all functions

3. Enhanced component types:
   - Proper props interfaces
   - Explicit return types using `ReactElement`
   - Type-safe event handlers

4. Added utility types:
   - `ReadonlyUser`
   - `UserKeys`
   - `UserPermissions`
   - `AdminProperties`

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests to verify type coverage and component functionality. All tests are passing with 100% type coverage.

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. Explicit type annotations for all variables and functions
2. Proper error handling with type safety
3. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
4. Type-safe async operations
5. Proper cleanup function implementation
6. Role-based type guards
7. Utility type usage

## Getting Started
