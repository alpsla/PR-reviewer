Here are the key points I noticed in the code changes: 1. **Migration to FastAPI** - The application has been migrated from Flask to FastAPI, which is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. - The main application logic is now in `wsgi.py`, which sets up the FastAPI app, routes, and middleware. 2. **Code Structure Analysis** - A new service `CodeStructureService` has been introduced to analyze the code structure of the files in a pull request. - It supports multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) and provides detailed analysis of code structures, imports, complexity metrics, and more. - The analysis results are integrated into the context passed to the Claude AI for review. 3. **Language Detection** - A new service `LanguageDetectionService` has been added to detect the primary and secondary programming languages in a repository or set of files. - It supports both GitHub API-based detection and content-based detection with confidence scoring. - The detected languages are also included in the context for the Claude AI review. 4. **Dependency Analysis** - The existing `DependencyService` has been enhanced with better error handling, file filtering, and more comprehensive analysis using `dependency-cruiser` and `madge` tools. - The analysis results now include dependency graphs, circular dependencies, external dependencies, and code structure analysis (exports, function lengths, code duplication, comment ratios). 5. **Asynchronous Operations** - Some operations in the `GitHubService` (`fetch_pr_files`, `fetch_pr_comments`) have been made asynchronous using `async`/`await` to improve performance. - The `review` route in `wsgi.py` is now an `async` function to support the asynchronous operations. 6. **Error Handling and Logging** - Improved error handling and logging have been implemented throughout the codebase, with more descriptive error messages and better separation of concerns. - The `wsgi.py` file now includes detailed startup checks, environment verification, and logging for various events (worker initialization, request processing, health checks). 7. **Deployment and Configuration** - The application is now configured to run with Gunicorn, a production-grade WSGI server. - Environment variables are used for configuration, including `DATABASE_URL`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `CLAUDE_API_KEY`. - The `wsgi.py` file includes custom Gunicorn event handlers for logging and configuration. 8. **Template Updates** - The `base.html` template has been updated to use the `url_for` function from FastAPI for generating static file URLs. - The flash message handling has been simplified, and error/success messages are now displayed using Bootstrap alerts. 9. **Dependencies and Requirements** - New dependencies have been added, including `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `hypercorn`, `jinja2`, `aiofiles`, and various code analysis tools (`esprima`, `astroid`, `lizard`, `mypy`, `pylint`). - The `requirements.txt` file has been updated with the new dependencies. Overall, these changes aim to improve the application's performance, scalability, and code analysis capabilities by migrating to FastAPI, introducing new services for code structure analysis and language detection, enhancing dependency analysis, and improving error handling, logging, and deployment configurations.
