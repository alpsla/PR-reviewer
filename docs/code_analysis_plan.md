# Code Analysis Implementation Plan

## 1. Core Language Detection System (Phase 1)
- LanguageDetectionService implementation with caching
- Confidence scoring system
- File type validation
- Explicit error handling
- Priority: Critical
- Timeline: First Sprint

## 2. Tool Registry System (Phase 1)
- Language-to-tool mapping registry
- Tool validation system
- Fallback options for each tool
- Dynamic tool configuration
- Priority: Critical
- Timeline: First Sprint

## 3. Analysis Pipeline (Phase 2)
- Parallel execution engine
- Result caching mechanism
- Validation/sanitization layer
- Partial results support
- Priority: High
- Timeline: Second Sprint

## 4. Language Support Rollout
### Phase 1 (Critical)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (eslint, tsc)
- Python (pylint, radon)

### Phase 2 (High)
- Java (checkstyle)
- Go (golangci-lint)

### Phase 3 (Medium)
- Additional languages based on usage metrics

## 5. Advanced Features (Phase 3)
- Trend analysis
- Language-specific thresholds
- Code smell detection
- API stability metrics
- Documentation coverage
- Priority: Medium
- Timeline: Third Sprint

## Implementation Notes
- Sequential language implementation approach
- Quick language detection with basic metrics first
- Progressive enhancement of features
- Regular validation and testing cycles
